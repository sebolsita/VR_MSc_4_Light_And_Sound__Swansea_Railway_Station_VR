<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]([https://example.com](https://github.com/sebolsita/VR_MSc_4_Light_And_Sound__Swansea_Railway_Station_VR/assets/146569314/01ce126a-8ba8-4257-8d30-6fcda9e2989b))



### Assignment Objectives

- **Achieve Realism**: Create a Unity-based 3D environment that significantly enhances UX and user immersion through:
  - **Engaging Scene Content**: The scene can be as ordinary as a waiting room but must captivate users through its realism.
  - **Thoughtful Design**: Incorporate lighting and sound effects designed to achieve a high level of realism within a performance-optimized application.

- **Incorporate Interactive Elements**:
  - **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: Populate the scene with NPCs to add life and interaction.
  - **A/V Objects**: Use interactable audio/visual objects, such as light switches or radios, to enhance realism.
  - **Directional Sound and Reverb Zones**: Implement sound strategically to mimic real-world auditory experiences.
  - **Realistic Baked Lighting**: Utilize baked lighting techniques for a more natural and immersive environment.

- **Use of Physically Scanned Items**: 
  - Integrate at least one physically scanned item into the scene, whether as an NPC or another object, to further authenticity.

- **Demonstration Video**: 
  - Produce a video showcasing the scene and the implemented audio/visual effects.

- **Research and Documentation**:

  - **2 Page Report**: Conduct research and write a report focusing on one of the following areas:
    - Current or future graphics techniques in VR rendering.
    - The use of sound in immersive applications.
    - Performance and optimization techniques in VR applications.

  - **1 Page Reflection**: Reflect on the project, detailing the development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation and Running the Application

### Windows Instructions

1. **Locate the Downloaded File**: Navigate to your `Downloads` folder or the location where you saved the downloaded `.exe` file.
2. **Launch the Application**: Double-click on `Swansea Railway Station.exe` to start the application.

#### Open the Application in Your VR Headset

- **For Oculus Quest (or Similar VR Headsets)**:
  1. **Connect Your Headset to the PC**: If you haven't already, connect your Oculus Quest to your PC using a compatible USB-C cable. For a wireless connection, ensure that Air Link is properly set up and enabled on both your PC and headset.
  2. **Allow Access**: If prompted on your headset, select 'Allow' to permit access to data from your PC.
  3. **Enable Oculus Link**: On your Oculus Quest, enable Oculus Link via the prompt on the headset to access PC VR content. This step bridges your PC's VR application output directly to your headset.
  4. **Wear Your Headset**: Once Oculus Link is enabled, put on your headset. You should see the PC VR environment displayed in your VR space.
  5. **Launch the Application**: With the application already running on your PC, you should be able to access it directly from within the VR interface provided by Oculus Link or similar software for other headsets.

Ensure your VR headset is correctly configured and recognized by your PC. Refer to the headset's user manual or official support channels for specific setup instructions or troubleshooting steps.

### Oculus Quest StandAlone Instructions
  (Using SideQuest)

To install and run applications not available on the Oculus Store, you can use SideQuest. This is a useful tool for managing, installing, and browsing apps for Oculus Quest. Here's how to get started:

1. **Enable Developer Mode on Oculus Quest**
   - Open the Oculus app on your mobile device.
   - Select 'Settings' at the bottom right, then select your Oculus Quest headset and tap 'More Settings'.
   - Tap 'Developer Mode' and then switch it on. You may need to create a developer account if you haven't already done so.

2. **Install SideQuest on Your Computer**
   - Visit the [SideQuest website](https://sidequestvr.com/) and download the latest version of SideQuest for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on their website.

3. **Connect Your Oculus Quest to Your Computer**
   - Use a high-quality USB cable to connect your Oculus Quest to your computer. If prompted on your Oculus Quest, allow USB debugging from your computer (you can check 'Always allow from this computer' to skip this step in the future).

4. **Install the Application Using SideQuest**
   - Open SideQuest on your computer.
   - Drag and drop the APK file for the application (you need to download the APK file for the Oculus Quest version of the application from the Releases section of this GitHub repository) into the SideQuest window to install it on your Oculus Quest.

5. **Find and Run the Application on Oculus Quest**
   - Put on your Oculus Quest headset.
   - Navigate to the 'Library' from the bottom menu.
   - Select the 'Unknown Sources' section to see all apps installed outside the Oculus Store. 
   - Find and select the application (e.g., `Swansea Railway Station`) to start it.

Remember, applications installed through SideQuest or directly via APK may not appear in your regular Oculus Quest library. Always check the 'Unknown Sources' list to find and run these apps.
