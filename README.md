<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


## Assignment Objectives

- **Achieve Realism**: Create a Unity-based 3D environment that significantly enhances UX and user immersion through:
  - **Engaging Scene Content**: The scene can be as ordinary as a waiting room but must captivate users through its realism.
  - **Thoughtful Design**: Incorporate lighting and sound effects designed to achieve a high level of realism within a performance-optimized application.

- **Incorporate Interactive Elements**:
  - **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: Populate the scene with NPCs to add life and interaction.
  - **A/V Objects**: Use interactable audio/visual objects, such as light switches or radios, to enhance realism.
  - **Directional Sound and Reverb Zones**: Implement sound strategically to mimic real-world auditory experiences.
  - **Realistic Baked Lighting**: Utilize baked lighting techniques for a more natural and immersive environment.

- **Use of Physically Scanned Items**: 
  - Integrate at least one physically scanned item into the scene, whether as an NPC or another object, to further authenticity.

- **Demonstration Video**: 
  - Produce a video showcasing the scene and the implemented audio/visual effects.

## Research and Documentation

- **2 Page Report**: Conduct research and write a report focusing on one of the following areas:
  - Current or future graphics techniques in VR rendering.
  - The use of sound in immersive applications.
  - Performance and optimization techniques in VR applications.

- **1 Page Reflection**: Reflect on the project, detailing the development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Consultation of Marking Rubric

- Review the marking rubric at an early stage to ensure the project aligns with the assessment criteria and maximizes the potential grade.

This project allowed me to apply and expand upon the VR skills and knowledge acquired during my MSc Virtual Reality studies, with a specific focus on creating immersive and realistic 3D environments.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation and Running the Application

### Windows Instructions

1. **Download the Release**
   - Navigate to the Releases section of this GitHub repository and download the latest version of the application, typically named something like `Swansea Railway Station.exe`.

2. **Connect Your Headset to the Computer**
   - Use a USB cable to connect your VR headset to your computer. If prompted on the headset, allow data access from the computer.

3. **Run the Application**
   - Locate the downloaded `.exe` file in your Downloads folder or wherever you saved it. Double-click on `Swansea Railway Station.exe` to launch the application. Make sure your VR headset is on and set up correctly to start experiencing the environment.

### Oculus Quest Instructions (Using SideQuest)

To install and run applications not available on the Oculus Store, you can use SideQuest. This is a useful tool for managing, installing, and browsing apps for Oculus Quest. Here's how to get started:

1. **Enable Developer Mode on Oculus Quest**
   - Open the Oculus app on your mobile device.
   - Select 'Settings' at the bottom right, then select your Oculus Quest headset and tap 'More Settings'.
   - Tap 'Developer Mode' and then switch it on. You may need to create a developer account if you haven't already done so.

2. **Install SideQuest on Your Computer**
   - Visit the [SideQuest website](https://sidequestvr.com/) and download the latest version of SideQuest for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on their website.

3. **Connect Your Oculus Quest to Your Computer**
   - Use a high-quality USB cable to connect your Oculus Quest to your computer. If prompted on your Oculus Quest, allow USB debugging from your computer (you can check 'Always allow from this computer' to skip this step in the future).

4. **Install the Application Using SideQuest**
   - Open SideQuest on your computer.
   - Drag and drop the APK file for the application (you need to download the APK file for the Oculus Quest version of the application from the Releases section of this GitHub repository) into the SideQuest window to install it on your Oculus Quest.

5. **Find and Run the Application on Oculus Quest**
   - Put on your Oculus Quest headset.
   - Navigate to the 'Library' from the bottom menu.
   - Select the 'Unknown Sources' section to see all apps installed outside the Oculus Store. 
   - Find and select the application (e.g., `Swansea Railway Station`) to start it.

Remember, applications installed through SideQuest or directly via APK may not appear in your regular Oculus Quest library. Always check the 'Unknown Sources' list to find and run these apps.
