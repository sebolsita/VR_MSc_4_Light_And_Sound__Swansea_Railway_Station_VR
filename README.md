<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

## Key Goals

- **Realism and Immersion**
  - The environment should offer a high degree of realism, engaging users through:
    - Superior graphics to make even mundane scenes captivating.
    - Well-designed lighting to enhance the scene's authenticity.
    - High-quality sound effects to improve the overall user experience.

- **Lighting and Sound Effects**
  - Focus on lighting and sound design, using:
    - Directional sound to mimic real-life auditory experiences.
    - Reverb zones for richer audio environments.
    - Realistic baked lighting for natural-looking illumination.

- **Interactivity**
  - Incorporate elements to strengthen the user's sense of presence, including:
    - NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to populate the environment.
    - A/V interactable objects, such as light switches or radios, for enhanced interaction.

- **Use of Physically Scanned Items**
  - Enhance scene depth and authenticity by incorporating at least one physically scanned item, adding to the environment's realism.

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Ensure the application is optimized for performance, focusing on:
    - Responsiveness to ensure quick application reaction to user input.
    - Efficiency to maintain smooth operation on target hardware.

- **Documentation and Reflection**
  - Submit documentation detailing the project's development and findings, including:
    - A 2-page report on a chosen research topic.
    - A 1-page reflection on the project's development process and outcomes.

- **Assessment Awareness**
  - Early familiarization with the marking rubric to guide the project towards achieving the best possible mark.

- **Showcase Video**
  - A video demonstration highlighting the project's realism and immersion efforts through the scene and the A/V effects used.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation and Running the Application

### Windows Instructions

1. **Download the Release**
   - Navigate to the Releases section of this GitHub repository and download the latest version of the application, typically named something like `Swansea Railway Station.exe`.

2. **Connect Your Headset to the Computer**
   - Use a USB cable to connect your VR headset to your computer. If prompted on the headset, allow data access from the computer.

3. **Run the Application**
   - Locate the downloaded `.exe` file in your Downloads folder or wherever you saved it. Double-click on `Swansea Railway Station.exe` to launch the application. Make sure your VR headset is on and set up correctly to start experiencing the environment.

### Oculus Quest Instructions (Using SideQuest)

To install and run applications not available on the Oculus Store, you can use SideQuest. This is a useful tool for managing, installing, and browsing apps for Oculus Quest. Here's how to get started:

1. **Enable Developer Mode on Oculus Quest**
   - Open the Oculus app on your mobile device.
   - Select 'Settings' at the bottom right, then select your Oculus Quest headset and tap 'More Settings'.
   - Tap 'Developer Mode' and then switch it on. You may need to create a developer account if you haven't already done so.

2. **Install SideQuest on Your Computer**
   - Visit the [SideQuest website](https://sidequestvr.com/) and download the latest version of SideQuest for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on their website.

3. **Connect Your Oculus Quest to Your Computer**
   - Use a high-quality USB cable to connect your Oculus Quest to your computer. If prompted on your Oculus Quest, allow USB debugging from your computer (you can check 'Always allow from this computer' to skip this step in the future).

4. **Install the Application Using SideQuest**
   - Open SideQuest on your computer.
   - Drag and drop the APK file for the application (you need to download the APK file for the Oculus Quest version of the application from the Releases section of this GitHub repository) into the SideQuest window to install it on your Oculus Quest.

5. **Find and Run the Application on Oculus Quest**
   - Put on your Oculus Quest headset.
   - Navigate to the 'Library' from the bottom menu.
   - Select the 'Unknown Sources' section to see all apps installed outside the Oculus Store. 
   - Find and select the application (e.g., `Swansea Railway Station`) to start it.

Remember, applications installed through SideQuest or directly via APK may not appear in your regular Oculus Quest library. Always check the 'Unknown Sources' list to find and run these apps.
